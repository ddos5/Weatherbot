**Weatherbot** is a lightweight and efficient Telegram bot designed to provide real-time weather updates. This project was developed to simplify checking meteorological data directly within the messenger interface, eliminating the need for third-party weather apps.

The bot utilizes external APIs to fetch accurate data and presents it in a user-friendly format.

## Functionality

* **Real-time Weather Data:** The bot connects to a weather API to retrieve the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any requested location.

* **City Search:** Users can request weather information by simply sending the name of the city. The bot processes the input and queries the backend for the specific location.

* **Configuration Management:** The project uses a dedicated `config.py` file to securely handle API keys and tokens, separating sensitive data from the main logic.

* **Telegram Integration:** Built specifically for the Telegram platform (`main_weather_tg_bot.py`), ensuring fast response times and mobile-friendly output.

## HOW TO USE

* **Clone the repository**
  ```bash
  git clone [https://github.com/ВАШ_НИКНЕЙМ/Weatherbot.git](https://github.com/ВАШ_НИКНЕЙМ/Weatherbot.git)
